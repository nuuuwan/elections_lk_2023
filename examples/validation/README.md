I think the paper will be stronger if you have a validation section. The classic stats way is via scenarios (or robustness testing)

- Scenario 1: You generate data with linear trends (as ground truth), then use your method and say it’s the same 
- Scenario 2: You generate your data with non-linear, trends (do the above) 
- Scenario 3: You create some cases where there are more dependencies, like movements between districts
